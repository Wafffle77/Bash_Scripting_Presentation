## Bash Scripting

This repository contains a presentation on bash scripting, as well as some simple example bash scripts.
Almost all of the information is sourced from the [Bash Reference Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html).

- The `slides` directory contains the Markdown source for all the slides
- The `example_scripts` directory has the example scripts.
  - It also has `slides.sh`, which can be used to compile the slides into a [Slidy](https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/)-based HTML/CSS/JS presentation.
