## What is Bash?
- Bash, or the Bourne-Again SHell, is a command line interpreter.
- This means its responsibility is to allow the user to interface with other programs on the operating system. 
- In addition to just running commands, Bash allows the user to combine multiple commands with each other to extend their behavior.
- You can also store commands in a script to execute them later.
- Bash is a full programming language.
