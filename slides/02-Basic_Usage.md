## Basic usage

- Just write out the command you want followed by its arguments.
- If an argument has a space or other special characters in it, youâ€™ll have to escape the characters with a backslash or surround them in quotes.
- Multiple commands on the same line can be separated with semicolons.
- The only type is string!
